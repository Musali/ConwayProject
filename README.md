# ConwayProject
Using mpiexec to paralyze 1 step of the Conway game of life. Rank 0 splitting up the width of the grid for the rest of the processes. After that each process will return the new living and dead cells back. By creating a string that splits up the grid we can replicate the joining function in threading. Project was completed with Emma and Muneeba.
